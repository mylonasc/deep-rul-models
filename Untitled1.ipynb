      " |  `Dense` implements the operation:\n",

      " |  passed as the `activation` argument, `kernel` is a weights matrix\n",

      " |  \n",
      " |  Note: If the input to the layer has a rank greater than 2, then `Dense`\n",
      " |  computes the dot product between the `inputs` and the `kernel` along the\n",
      " |  last axis of the `inputs` and axis 1 of the `kernel` (using `tf.tensordot`).\n",
      " |  For example, if input has dimensions `(batch_size, d0, d1)`,\n",
      " |  then we create a `kernel` with shape `(d1, units)`, and the `kernel` operates\n",
      " |  along axis 2 of the `input`, on every sub-tensor of shape `(1, 1, d1)`\n",
