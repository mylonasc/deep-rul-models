## Deep learning for remaining useful life prediction

This is a repository that contains some legacy code (mainly tensorflow 2) that corresponds to different experiments performed for remaining useful life prediction. 

The code is not supported and it is recommended that future users try to implement the techniques described from scratch. It is only provided as reference, since there was some interest in accessing the code.
