## Bearings simulation
It was attempted to have an actual dynamic model of bearings. Although the model may yield with some effort realistic results, 
the degradation patterns are not expected to be realistic. Since the model would only be used to derive a data-driven method for degradation, 
the relative effort vs yield of this approach was judged as bad and this was abandonded. It is left here for reference and potential future work.
